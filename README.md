# ssh-config-manager-cli

## What is this?

A cli application to add/remove/edit hosts in `~/.ssh/config` file

## Why?

Well, since I'm not a talented developer/software engineer/programmer/problem solver, I've been tasked with
maintaining the deployment/staging and the infrastructure servers. Which comes with the baggage of editing
my `~/.ssh/config` file often. It has come to a point that I'm committed to write this tool üòê

## Why Go?

Ummm, first thought to write with python, then realized if I do so, Sarim bhai will tell me
that's terrible idea. So, thought to write as a bash script. Then I remembered that I've never
written any bash scripts. Finally, decided to brush up my golang.
